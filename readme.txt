This is a basic calculator along with some trigononmetric functionalities like sine, cosine etc. This was built using VBA scripting.
You need to click on the Calculator button and a Calculator in the form of a UserForm will show up.
The operations '+', '-', '*', '/', '%', and '^' are designed to operate on 2 numbers. You need to enter the first num then press button for any of these operations and then second number and then press '='.
The operations 'sqrt', 'x^2', 'sin', 'cos', and 'tan' are designed to operate on a single number. You need to enter the number first and then press button for any of these operations and result will be on the display bar.
Thank You.
